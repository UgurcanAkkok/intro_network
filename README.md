BAU CMP2204 Introduction to Networks Term Project - Peer to Peer File Sharing Application


Launch P2P_server first, then launch Service_Announcer and Service_Listener. 

If you want to host, just wait someone to connect;
if you want to get files across instead, run P2P_downloader.

Do not ask the files that you already have on your "files" folder, it will replace them with empty chunks.

Open download_log.txt for download history;
     server_log.txt for sent history.
